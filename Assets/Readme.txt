This game was made in approximately 13 hours.

I could not find an exact match for the font, which might make it look less similar to the original game.

However, everything else is perfectly timed and measured to match the original game.

The code is the best I could do in this timespan. There is a lot of room for improvement, with the most 
important one being using bits instead of the Mathf library since the game is based on powers of 2.

If I were to add the level mechanic, after a touch release, I would take the sum and invoke an event 
for a UIManager to handle a slider with that sum.
